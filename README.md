# 📰 NYT Clone – React News App

NYT Clone is a web application developed as a front-end project to simulate a modern news platform using real-time data from the official New York Times API.  
Users can explore top news by category, search articles, save favorites, and switch between light and dark mode.

This project was built from scratch using React and demonstrates routing, API integration, theming, and responsive design.
